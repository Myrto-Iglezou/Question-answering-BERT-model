# Question-answering-BERT-model

### Project description

Build a BERT-based model which returns “an answer”, given a user question and a
passage which includes the answer of the question. For this question answering task, you
will use the SQuAD 2.0 dataset which has been discussed in the lecture “Textual Question
Answering”. You should start with the BERT-base pretrained model “bert-base-uncased”
and fine-tune it to have a question answering task as explained in the lecture on BERT.
Note that this has been done already by the BERT team and it is available publicly, but
we would like you to try to implement this by yourself.
